To calculate ball trajectory for bowling:
========================================
Assumption: When the bowler releases the ball, that point can be assumed
to be the peak of the projectile motion path or the trajectory.

Inputs: 
1. Ball position at peak of the trajectory, which gives h 
2. Point on the pitch where the ball will be pitched, which gives d (= R / 2)
   where R = range of the trajectory

Calculations:

Given h; initial velocity y component is: vely = sqrt (* 2 h g)
where g is 9.81

Using vely, peak time: peakt = vely / g

Hence total time for trajectory motion or max time: maxt= 2 * peakt

Since we are using half the trajectory, at the peak, x = d. Then using 
x = velx * t where velx = initial velocity x component
	     and t = peak time

Then velx = d / peakt

Now using velx and vely while incrementing from peakt to maxt in increments
of 1/24 or 1/30 based upon frame rate, the co-ordinates can be calculated
as:

x = velx * t
and y = vely * t - g * t * t / 2

 
To calculate ball trajectory for strokes:
========================================

Inputs:
1. Ball speed after it hits the bat, or the initial velocity for the trajectory
2. Point on the ground where ball will land, which gives R where
   R = range of the trajectory

Calculations:

We can calculate the angle of elevation thetha as:

thetha = (sin-inv (R * g / (vel * vel))) / 2 
where sin-inv = sine inverse

Using vel and angle of theta, initial x and y components of velocity are:
velx = vel * cos thetha
vely = vel * sin thetha

Total time of flight is maxt = 2 * vely / g where
vely / g = peakt , peak time

Thus using velx and vely while incrementing from 0 to maxt in increments 
of 1/24 or 1/30 based upon frame rate, the coordinates can be calculated
as:

x = velx * t
and y = vely * t - g * t * t / 2

Now you can repeat this for multiple ball bounce till it reaches the final landing point.

For Ball Mesh
=============

For bowling as well as strokes; first up compute the trajectory vertices.

For bowling, the rotation is always 90 anticlockwise along Y axis.

For strokes, the rotation is angle between line formed between batsman position and
(final) landing point; and the horizontal x axis.

Now for each vertex of the trajectory path, compute the translations from the origin.
Draw the ball mesh (gets drawan at origin) and apply those translations. Now
apply the rotation. You will find the ball moving along the trajectory path!
